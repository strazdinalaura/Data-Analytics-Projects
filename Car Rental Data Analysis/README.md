This project is a simulation where I was hired to make recommendations about how to make better business decisions for the Lariat Rental car company. The Lariat executives tasked me to identify ways in which to lower costs and increase revenue generated by their rental car fleet. I was provided with raw data in 4 Excel worksheets and produced deliverables based on the raw data and business objectives. I produced an Excel model they can use to make data-informed decisions about their fleet and a PowerPoint deck that provides an analysis of the problem and provides recommendations. This was followed by a live presentation in which I presented my findings to a Lariat executive.
